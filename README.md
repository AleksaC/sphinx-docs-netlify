Keep sphinx docs up to date and deploy them to Netlify.

## About üìñ
This repo includes a basic sphinx configuration for documenting python modules and
deploying docs to Netlify. Default Sphinx Makefile is modified to use apidoc to
automatically generate docs for specified modules. There is also a CircleCI job
that automatically updates the docs once new submodule has been added.

The main reason why I use this setup instead of Read The Docs is because I'm already
familiar with Netlify after using it on many sites. I also thinks that in terms of
features it is probably better than rtd.

**Note**: Do not set `docs/` as base in `netlify.toml` because it could lead to
stale documentation. Changes to docstrings are not reflected in `rst` files  generated
by `apidoc` but instead added by `autodoc` during html generation. Netlify cancels 
builds that don't affect the base directory, so changes to docstrings would not
trigger a build.

**Another note**: Netlify status badges consider canceled builds as failed, 
hopefully this gets fixed soon.
